# Welcome to my Machine Learning Portfolio !
You will find here some examples of my working using Python for data handling, visualization and machine learning. The files stem from Kaggle competitions and compiled with Jupyter Notebook and PyCharm.

If you're using my code, you are welcome to connect with me on LinkedIn and optionally send me feedback to help steer this or other code I have already published: [Tharcisio Leone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tharcisio-leone/).
